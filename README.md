# HomeSchool_HookUp

"Homeschool Hookup” is an application that connects the students and parents of a certain radius to create a social pod that’s tailored to the needs of the students and the parents.

## Task

With our team, we conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem. In creating our first collaborative full-stack application, we combine a robust back end--with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication—-to an intuitive front end. We continue to build on the agile development methodologies we’ve used throughout this course, like storing our project code in GitHub, managing our work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

## User Story

```md
 As a parent of school-age children, I need an app that helps me connect with other families and resources like pod, projects and self care  so that my student has optimal social and learning opportunities outside of a traditional school setting.
 ```

## Description
